                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>An organized and dedicated graduate of Keith Country Day School (KCDS) with a 4.14/4.0 GPA. At KCDS, 
                    I co-founded and advocated for Graphic Design and Game Development programs, while also being involved 
                    in a vast number of extracurriculars such as Robotics Club, Game Club, Chess Club, US Chorus, and 
                    Model United Nations. Now, I am pursuing a BS and MS degree in Game Design & Development at Rochester 
                    Institute of Technology (RIT) with two additional minors in Cybersecurity and Japanese. Signed as the 
                    only freshman onto RIT's Division 1 Valorant Esports team, serving as the main Initiator. Community-
                    oriented and well-rounded scholar excited to seek more opportunities and career development.</p>
